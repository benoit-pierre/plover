About
-----

Plover (rhymes with "lover") is a desktop application that allows anyone
to use stenography to write on their computer, up to speeds of 200WPM
and beyond.

Plover is part of the `Open Steno Project <http://opensteno.org>`__. The
Open Steno Project's goal is to provide everything you need to learn
machine shorthand on your own, from free software, to cheap hardware, to
learning resources.

Plover is GPLv2+ as of version 3.1.0. See `LICENSE.txt <LICENSE.txt>`__
for details.

Installation
------------

Plover runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac.

View the `installation

Contributing

The Open Steno Project is always growing, and could use your help!

Donations
~~~~~~~~~

Plover is developed by volunteers. Donations to Open Steno help fund new
projects as well as any maintenance costs with publishing Plover.

`**Donate here**, donations of any size are very
appreciated! <http://stenoknight.com/plover/donatepage.html>`__

Programming
~~~~~~~~~~~

Plover is a cross-platform desktop application written in Python. To
contribute to Plover, see `CONTRIBUTING.md <CONTRIBUTING.md>`__

If Python isn't your thing, there are other steno-related projects,
including `StenoJig <https://github.com/JoshuaGrams/steno-jig>`__
(JavaScript) and
`StenoTray <https://github.com/SmackleFunky/StenoTray>`__ (Java).

Writing, Art, UX, and Web Design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  The `Plover Wiki <https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover/wiki>`__
   discusses Plover and Open Steno in general. Edits to the Wiki and new
   page ideas are welcome.
-  Graphic art for Plover and stenography in general is always
   appreciated. The app's icons are worked on at
   `morinted/plover\_icons <https://github.com/morinted/plover_icons>`__.
   You may consider reimagining or reposing `Plover's mascot,
   Dolores <http://plover.stenoknight.com/2010/10/new-logo.html>`__.
-  UX improvement suggestions are welcome. Plover runs on Windows, Mac,
   and Linux, and should be powerful but out of the way, which poses
   some interesting challenges. Please drop in to the Discord server to
   brainstorm with users and the developers.
-  Open Steno has websites that accept contributions, including the
   `Open Steno Project homepage <http://opensteno.org>`__
   (`source <https://github.com/openstenoproject/openstenoproject.github.io>`__)
   and `Plover's homepage <http://opensteno.org/plover>`__
   (`source <https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover/tree/gh-pages>`__).
